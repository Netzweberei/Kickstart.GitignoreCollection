# .gitignore Collection

A piece of best practice all around the world.

Just mix up your .gitignore composed of the following components:

* OS
* IDE
* Software
* Misc

If you're working in a team, your collaborator should do the same respective their techniques & tools and merge it with the project's gitignore.

# Degree of Versioning/Exclusion

Git Ignore Files are planned to become divided into different degrees of Versioning, depending on which goal you plan to achieve:

* Maximum Versioning (some kinda Backup Strategy) â€” grab a Git Ignore File marked as "Min"
* Minimal Versioning (just for tracking your manipulations) - grab the "Full" ones
* Customized Versioning - just mix a bit!

If you're wondering why we've suffixed those Files by "Min|Full" contrariwise to their effect regarding Versioning: The Suffix describes the degree of File Exclusion, e.g. "Full" means most files (Core, etc.) are not being versioned in order to keep the Repo clean and lean.
